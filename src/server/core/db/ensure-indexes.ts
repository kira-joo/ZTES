/**
 * Guarantees every declared index exists before the application serves a
 * request, and fails loudly if one does not.
 *
 * ## Why this is a correctness concern rather than a performance one
 *
 * A unique index is not an optimisation here — several of this application's
 * safety properties *are* the index, and the code around them is written on
 * that assumption:
 *
 * - **Idempotency.** `begin()` inserts and treats a duplicate-key error as
 *   "someone else won". With no index, both inserts succeed and both callers
 *   are told they own the key. Measured: 20 of 20 runs, both callers claimed
 *   it; with the index, 0 of 20. That is a double-submit becoming two orders,
 *   silently, on the money path.
 * - **Customer email.** Signup pre-checks with `exists()` and its own comment
 *   calls that racy, "backed by the unique index for correctness". Measured:
 *   20 of 20 runs created two accounts on one email without the index, 0 of 20
 *   with it. Login's `findOne({ email })` then picks one nondeterministically.
 * - **Order numbers.** The counter's upsert is only atomic against a
 *   concurrent insert because of the index; without it, concurrent callers
 *   each create their own counter and each is handed `0001`.
 *
 * None of these fail loudly when the index is absent. They quietly stop being
 * true.
 *
 * ## Why the indexes could be absent at all
 *
 * Mongoose builds declared indexes in the BACKGROUND when a model is first
 * used, and no operation waits for that to finish. The window is small on an
 * idle machine and wide under load — which is exactly when concurrent requests
 * arrive.
 *
 * ## Build, or assert and refuse to start?
 *
 * Both are defensible and the trade-off is worth stating rather than defaulting.
 *
 * **Asserting only** is the right end state for a large production database.
 * Building an index on a live collection is expensive, and having an arbitrary
 * request trigger it is how a deploy turns into an outage. Indexes get created
 * by a deploy step, and the application refuses to serve if they are missing.
 *
 * **This builds, then asserts**, for three reasons specific to where this
 * product currently is:
 *
 * 1. `autoIndex` is on, so Mongoose already builds these at runtime today.
 *    Awaiting that is not new risk; it is waiting for something already
 *    happening.
 * 2. There is no deploy-time index step yet. Assert-only would refuse to start
 *    against any fresh database — every new environment, every CI run, every
 *    developer's first `docker compose up`.
 * 3. The collections are small and the product is pre-release, so the
 *    expensive-first-build case does not exist yet.
 *
 * **The trigger for changing this** is real production volume: at that point
 * set `autoIndex: false`, create indexes in the deploy pipeline, and drop the
 * build half here — the verification half already does the right thing and
 * would need no change.
 *
 * The assert half runs unconditionally either way, so a build that silently
 * fails is still a startup failure rather than a silent loss of a guarantee.
